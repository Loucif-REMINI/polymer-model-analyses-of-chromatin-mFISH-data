:bar_chart: Multiplexed FISH Data Analysis Script

This Python script, developed by Loucif Remini, Midas Segers, and Enrico Carlon, serves as a tool for the analysis of multiplexed FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) data from Bintu et al (2018). The script is designed to process any data from a CSV file giving the 3D spatial coordinates of fluorescent probes and provides comprehensive insights into chromatin structure based on the methodology outlined in the publication "Chromatin structure from high-resolution microscopy: scaling laws and microphase separation" by Remini et al. (2023).

:rocket: Features

:mag: Identification of Coexisting Chromatin Phases
The script analyzes pairwise probability distance distributions, providing evidence of two coexisting chromatin phases. Gain insights into the dynamic organization of chromatin structures.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: Scaling Behavior Analysis
Explore the scaling behavior of effective chromatin and distinct phases. This feature offers valuable insights into the hierarchical organization of chromatin structures.

:triangular_ruler: Phases Radii Summary
Visualize phases radii for any pair of tags (i, j) through informative heatmaps. Understand the spatial relationships and structural nuances within chromatin.

:microscope: Single Cell Analysis and Fit
The script offers a detailed single-cell analysis, including fitting procedures. Dive into the behavior of chromatin at the individual cell level for a more nuanced understanding.

:crystal_ball: Beta Phase Position Prediction
Predict the position of the beta phase in single cells, enhancing predictive capabilities. This feature contributes to a deeper understanding of chromatin dynamics.

:computer: Usage

To utilize the script, input your data in CSV format and execute the provided functions. The script will generate visualizations and summaries, offering a comprehensive overview of your multiplexed FISH data.
The data used can be downloaded from Bogdan Bintu's repository
