# Multiplexed FISH Data Analysis Script

This Python script, developed by Loucif Remini, Midas Segers, John Palmeri, Jean-Charles Walter, Andrea Parmeggiani, and Enrico Carlon, serves as a tool for the analysis of multiplexed FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization) data fro Bintu et al (2018). The script is designed to process data from a CSV file, providing comprehensive insights into chromatin structure based on the methodology outlined in the publication "Chromatin structure from high-resolution microscopy: scaling laws and microphase separation" by Remini et al. (2023).

## Features

- **Identification of Coexisting Chromatin Phases:**
  The script generates evidence of two coexisting chromatin phases by analyzing pairwise probability distance distributions.

- **Scaling Behavior Analysis:**
  Explore the scaling behavior of the effective chromatin and distinct phases, offering valuable insights into the organization of chromatin structures.

- **Phases Radii Summary:**
  Visualize the phases radii for any pair of tags (i, j) through informative heatmaps, aiding in the interpretation of spatial relationships.

- **Single Cell Analysis and Fit:**
  The script provides a detailed single-cell analysis, including fitting procedures, to better understand chromatin behavior at the individual cell level.

- **Beta Phase Position Prediction:**
  Predict the position of the beta phase in single cells, enhancing predictive capabilities and contributing to a more nuanced understanding of chromatin dynamics.

## Usage

To utilize the script, input your data in CSV format and execute the provided functions. The script will generate visualizations and summaries, offering a comprehensive overview of your multiplexed FISH data.
The data used can be doewnloaded from Bogdan Bintu's repository : https://github.com/BogdanBintu/ChromatinImaging/tree/master/Data
## Publication Reference

The script is based on the methodology outlined in the publication "Chromatin structure from high-resolution microscopy: scaling laws and microphase separation" by Remini et al. (2023).
